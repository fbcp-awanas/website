Award
#I would like to trigger an award alert if all the sections for an award are complete.
#For one club, awards are given for every 4 sections completed.
#For some clubs, completing a section earns points, bonus points are awarded if parent
#signs that they have heard the verse at home, said word-perfect, and located in Bible.
#Would those be fields in this table or another?
#Puggles and Cubbies do not accrue points
#Not sure how to do this...
#During registration, I would like to be able to check if the child or leader needs a new uniform.
#If they do, I would like to open another form to input size, club, etc.
#The same thing will be needed for book for some clubs, but not all of them.
#Puggles will always need a new book and uniform.

#I need to be able to look at outstanding balance (dues + orders) per family and overall.
#I need to be able to see all payments or orders on a certain date.
#Dues are due twice a year.
#When kids check-in, I need the attendance to be recorded, and points awarded. I'm guessing I need a points ledger. Does that sound right?

#Maybe a column for each club date with a y/n. That would make it easy to see attendance trends.
